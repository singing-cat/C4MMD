In this case, the phrase \"\u4f5b\u4f5b\u7cfb\u80cc\u5355\u8bcd\" could be referring to someone who is relaxed and not overly concerned with the process of learning a new language. Alternatively, it could be a reference to someone who is content with their current level of knowledge and does not feel the need to push themselves further.\n"
